## Blamo Game Manual

The game is set in a different place depending on the game mode you choose.
* If you chose the racing mode the cars start on a oval track: 
  * The cars start on the straight, at the finish line.
  * You go around the track, staying on the asphalt as much as possible.(There are invisible checkpoints to prevent from making a short lap.)
  * Whichever player makes 7 laps first wins, and it asks if you want to play again.
